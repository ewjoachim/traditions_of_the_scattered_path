    @rebuscube

        an American man
        who speaks English fluently and predominantly
        a game designer
        a former software engineer
        an artist
        born in the mid-70s
        grew up in Massachusetts
        has lived for a long time in Berkeley, CA
  This book exists in the game world of Gorogoa
    Its existence may be the first time we learn that the hyperlinking we do in-game is a "tradition"
    If the book also turns out to be a hypertext, we shouldn't be surprised
    Most books in Gorogoa are about mystical esoterica; that may be true of this text
  This book was digitally produced
    A professional text layout tool was used, probably InDesign
  Sources of error or data loss
    We're human
      Converting scans to lines
      Breaking lines into glyphs
      Identifying glyphs
      Recombining glyphs into text
    The author is human
      Spell-check doesn't work on invented languages
      (Even if they're written in ASCII on a US keyboard layout)
    The manufacturers and publishers are human
      It's possible the pages changed order, but probably not
  This language is 22 characters
    So the characters probably share properties with letters of existing alphabets, most likely the  English alphabet
    Once we have a text, we can use statistical analysis to assign letters to glyphs
      Individual glyph frequency
      Glyph neighbor frequency
  This writing system is not doing any heavy lifting
    The only real punctuation is the period
    No commas, semicolons, colons
    No quote marks
    The hyphen is only used to break a word between lines
    No upper and lower case
      Some paragraphs begin with a drop cap, though, to indicate some logical division of the text
    We can assume that whatever's been written, is written in a "simple way"
  The blue and yellow text on the cover might allude to the blue and yellow goals in the game
  The division between blue and yellow on the cover is vertical, and splits an image of a book down the middle
    Might this mean that some text columns on different pages can be joined together?
    Or different booklets? Do we know for a fact that there's only one version of this booklet?

Goal 1: make the text and font for the body of the booklet
  Identify every glyph (~17,744) from every line (807) on every page of text (20)
  Compile identified glyphs back into clumps of lines of text
  Make a font in Illustrator
    Trace the glyphs, export as SVG, shove into an online font generator
  Retype the full text into text boxes in InDesign with the new font
    Letter spacing is going to be annoying
    Use overlay technique for accuracy
    Use hidden whitespace characters to guarantee proper word separation
  Update TXT from InDesign text
    Preserve paragraph separation
    Remove hyphens and unnecessary newlines

Proposal
  Do the best we can
  Show our work, without infringing on copyright
  From time to time, check in with @rebuscube
    If we've made proven progress, we ask for inessential assistance like verification or suggested methodology improvements

Wrong hypotheses
  The writing system is an abugida
    Why?
      There are four glyphs on the cover and there are four syllables in "Gorogoa"
    Why not?
      The "Go-" syllables in "GOroGOa" correspond to two different glyphs on the cover
      It's doubtful that @rebuscube would have done that, especially with the most prominently displayed text
