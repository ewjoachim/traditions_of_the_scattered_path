# Traditions of the Scattered Path

The award-winning puzzle video game [Gorogoa](http://gorogoa.com/) had a
[limited collector
edition](https://www.iam8bit.com/collections/annapurna-interactive/products/gorogoa-nintendo-switch-physical-edition)
that came with a booklet, named "Traditions of the Scattered Path".
Little is known of this, except what the author said about it.

## Our complete, untranslated transcript of the booklet [can be found here](./transcript/joined_text.txt).
This script's alphabet has only 22 characters, and its only punctuation mark is the period.

We're trying to decipher the booklet. If you're interested in taking part, drop me a
line (twitter @ewjoachim or open an issue).

We have a Discord server, contact me for an invite.
